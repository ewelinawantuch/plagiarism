 Project by Ewelina Wantuch and Agata Nowak - Plagiarism Checker
 ***
 
This program compares two different text files written in English and provides information about the content of each of these files:

- was it written in a formal or informal style;
- was it written in British English or American English;
- what are the 5 most commonly used words in that text;
- what is the mean sentence length.

Based on the results of this comparison, the program generates the answers to two questions:

- what is the probability that both these files were written by the same author;
- how much of the second file is an act of plagiarism.

How to use Plagiarism Checker?
- load 2 text files by clicking the buttons 'Choose 1st file' and 'Choose 2nd file'.
- click te button 'Load you files' to get the results.
- click 'Save' to save the results as a text file or 'Quit' to close the program.

MAKE SURE BOTH TEXT FILES HAVE THE EXTENSION .TXT AND ARE WRITTEN IN ENGLISH!
